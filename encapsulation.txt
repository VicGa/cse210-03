How did you apply encapsulation to your program's design?

We applied encapsulation by taking into account the principles of designing 
a private code that can be re-usable and accessible. 
By the way, we are in the middle of the structure process. We are still 
creating the attributes and methods that we need for the final project, but 
we finished the design and attached it here as a png document.

As you see in the image, we have four principal classes and their methods. 
First, we have the "Director" which in this case it is called the Game_Master class.
This "Director" class enables and organize the rest of the methods that are: 

Guess.py: This class is in charge of the playerÂ´s guessing letter part
Puzzle.py: This class is responsible for creating a random list of words
Display.py: This class is in charge of displaying the lines and organizing the 
parachute structure
